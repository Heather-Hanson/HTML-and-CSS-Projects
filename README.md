# HTML and CSS Projects

This repository showcases my assignments and projects created during my HTML and CSS courses.

Projects:
- One-Page Website
- Portfolio Website

One-Page Website
This basic one page site demonstrates web site features such as: nav bar, slideshow, embedded video, and contact form.

Portfolio Website
This was the beginning of my Portfolio website.  It included the layout and CSS and includes additional CSS features beyond the One-Page Website such as background looping video, key frames, and responsive design.
